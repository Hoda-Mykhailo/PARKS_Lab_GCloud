# PARKS_Lab_GCloud

In this laboratory work, the PARKS framework was used, which allows you to calculate algorithms and more, on a remote machine. In this work, the sum of factorials was calculated. Also, this framework distributes the load on workers, thereby speeding up work. The program is written in the Python programming language.
